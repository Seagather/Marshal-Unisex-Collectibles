# UX

## Project Goals

The development of this project captures the essence of a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The idea is to create an e-commerce site for wrist watch lovers using the Django framework with PostgreSQL database, then static file hosting with AWS, and a functional payment system using Stripe platform. 

## UX Design

The application was structured using bootstrap to maintain wide browser compatibility, consistency in design and extensibility to render responsive and modern website.

#### Typography

The following fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used for the site:

**Roboto Slab** was used for the logo, navigation and titles of the site.

**Exo** was used for the contents of the site.

**Georgia** was used for the call to action button.


#### Colors

The color scheme used in this project were meant to present the motifs as aesthetic pleasure to users.
